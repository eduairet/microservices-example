# Microservices and the Organization

- A microservices architecture can significantly impact the organization, requiring changes in culture, processes, and team structures.
- A traditional team structure may not be suitable for a microservices architecture, as it requires cross-functional teams that can work independently on different services.
- Since microservices are designed to focus in the product and not in the project the ideal team should be small, cross-functional, and autonomous but it should be close to other teams like the UX team, the DevOps team, and the security team.
